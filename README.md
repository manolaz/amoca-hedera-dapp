# Hedera App

This is an example app that integrates Hedera using both the native Hedera gRPC APIs as well as
Ethereum JSON-RPC compatible endpoints. This app utilizes
[Reown AppKit](https://docs.reown.com/appkit/overview). For an example Hedera wallet
implementation see <https://github.com/hgraph-io/hedera-wallet>.

## Getting started

1. Fill out the .env file with a <https://cloud.reown.com> project id and Hedera rpc endpoints:
   <https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/core-concepts/smart-contracts/json-rpc-relay>.

```sh
## copy and then update the .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

3. Run the app

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Key considerations for integrating Hedera

The Hedera network provides gRPC and REST APIs that are consumed by Hedera SDKs and network
users.

Hedera supports the Ethereum JSON-RPC spec through a middle layer called the Hedera JSON-RPC
Relay. This relay is responsible for translating Ethereum JSON-RPC compatible API calls into
Hedera gRPC and REST API calls. To see a full list of supported methods, refer to
<https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-json-rpc-relay/blob/main/docs/rpc-api.md>

Apps and wallets that integrate Hedera can choose to use the Hedera JSON-RPC Relay to interact
with the network, directly use Hedera APIs and SDKs, or do both. A strong reason to leverage the
Hedera JSON-RPC Relay is to utilize existing tools and libraries available in the EVM ecosystem
such as Wagmi, Viem, AppKit, and WalletKit.

A strong reason to integrate Hedera via the native APIs is to fully support all account types
and native transaction types provided by Hedera.

In the context of Reown's WalletKit and AppKit, this is defined by the namespaces requested by
apps to wallets. For the EVM compatibility layer, the namespace is `eip155` and for Hedera
native transactions it is `hedera`.
